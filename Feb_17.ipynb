    "### Q1. What is MongoDB? Explain non-relational databases in short. In which scenarios it is preferred to use MongoDB over SQL databases?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: MongoDB is a document-oriented, NoSQL database that is designed for high scalability, performance, and flexibility. It is an open-source database that uses JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas, which means that it can store and retrieve data in a variety of formats without requiring a predefined schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are databases that store and retrieve data using a non-tabular approach. Unlike traditional relational databases, NoSQL databases do not use tables with fixed columns and rows. Instead, they use a flexible schema that can handle a wide range of data formats, including unstructured and semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Handling of large volumes of unstructured data is required.\n",
    "2. Scalability is a key requirement.\n",
    "3. The data schema is expected to change frequently.\n",
    "4. Rapid prototyping and agile development are required.\n",
    "5. Horizontal scaling is important."

    "### Q2. State and Explain the features of MongoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ams: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database that is known for its flexibility, scalability, and performance. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Dynamic schema: MongoDB uses a dynamic schema, which means that it can handle a wide range of data formats without requiring a predefined schema. This makes it easy to add or modify fields as needed, without the need for complex migrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. High scalability: MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling, which means that it can easily handle large volumes of data and high traffic loads. It also supports sharding, which allows data to be distributed across multiple servers for increased performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Document-based storage: MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents, which can include nested fields and arrays. This makes it easy to represent complex data structures and relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Rich query language: MongoDB supports a powerful query language that allows you to query and manipulate data in a variety of ways. It also supports indexing, which can greatly improve query performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. High availability: MongoDB supports automatic failover and replication, which ensures that your data is always available and up-to-date, even in the event of a server failure."

If no documents match the filter, nothing happens.\n",

It takes a filter parameter, which defines the criteria for selecting the documents to be deleted. All documents that match the filter are deleted. If no documents match the filter, nothing happens.\n",
    "\n",
