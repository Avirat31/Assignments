    "## Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Elastic Net Regression is a linear regression technique that combines the Lasso (L1) and Ridge (L2) regularization methods. It aims to overcome the limitations of both techniques by adding a penalty term that is a combination of both L1 and L2 penalties in the cost function. It can handle datasets with a high number of features and performs feature selection by encouraging some coefficients to be exactly zero."

    "## Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The optimal values of the regularization parameters (alpha and l1_ratio) in Elastic Net Regression are typically chosen through techniques like cross-validation. Grid search or random search over a range of parameter values can be used to find the combination that results in the best performance on a validation set."

    "\n",
    "Disadvantages: Requires tuning of regularization parameters and may not perform well with very large datasets."

    "## Q5. How do you interpret the coefficients in Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Interpretation of coefficients in Elastic Net Regression is similar to linear regression. Positive coefficients indicate a positive relationship with the target variable, negative coefficients indicate a negative relationship, and coefficients close to zero suggest little impact on the target variable."

    "## Q6. How do you handle missing values when using Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Handling missing values in Elastic Net Regression depends on the method used. You can impute missing values using mean, median, or other techniques before training the model. Some libraries handle missing values automatically."

    "\n",
    "Ans: To pickle and unpickle a trained Elastic Net Regression model in Python, you can use the pickle module. For pickling, use pickle.dump(model, file) to save the trained model to a file. For unpickling, use model = pickle.load(file) to load the model from the file."

    "\n",
    "Ans: The purpose of pickling a model in machine learning is to save the trained model to a file, allowing you to reuse it without retraining. Pickling helps save time and resources, especially when working with large datasets or complex models."
