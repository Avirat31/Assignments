    "## Q1. Describe the decision tree classifier algorithm and how it works to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Decision Tree Classifier is a machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features. It makes decisions by navigating from the root node (starting point) down to leaf nodes (end points) through a series of binary splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm Overview:\n",
    "- Select the best attribute (feature) to split the data based on some criterion (e.g., Gini impurity, entropy).\n",
    "- Create a node for that attribute and divide the data into subsets according to the attribute's values.\n",
    "- Recur on each subset, treating them as separate subproblems.\n",
    "- Continue recursively until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., maximum depth, minimum samples per leaf).\n",
    "- Assign the most common class label among the instances in a leaf node, which becomes the prediction for that leaf."

    "## Q2. Provide a step-by-step explanation of the mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The mathematical intuition behind decision tree classification involves choosing attributes that best separate classes. This is typically done by measuring impurity reduction using metrics like Gini impurity or entropy. Steps include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Calculate the impurity of the current node.\n",
    "2. For each attribute, calculate a measure of impurity reduction (e.g., information gain).\n",
    "3. Select the attribute with the highest impurity reduction and create a split.\n",
    "4. Recursively repeat steps for child nodes."

    "## Q3. Explain how a decision tree classifier can be used to solve a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A decision tree classifier for binary classification involves creating splits based on attributes to separate data into two classes (e.g., 0 and 1). As the tree grows, it learns to make decisions by navigating through splits, eventually leading to leaf nodes with class predictions. New instances traverse the tree, following attribute values, and end up at a leaf with a predicted class."

    "## Q4. Discuss the geometric intuition behind decision tree classification and how it can be used to make predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Geometrically, a decision tree divides the feature space into regions (bounded by decision boundaries). Each region corresponds to a leaf node with a predicted class label. Predictions are based on the majority class of training instances within each region. Decision boundaries are axis-aligned, meaning they are parallel to the feature axes."

It consists of four values: True Positive (TP), True Negative (TN), False Positive (FP), and False Negative (FN). It's used to calculate various performance metrics"

Precision, Recall, F1 Score, ROC Curve, AUC, etc., offer insights based on the context. Consider the business impact and the nature of the problem when selecting metrics."
