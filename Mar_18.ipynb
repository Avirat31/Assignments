    "## Q1. What is the Filter method in feature selection, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Filter method in feature selection is a technique that evaluates the relevance of each feature individually based on their characteristics, such as statistical measures or scores. It works by applying statistical tests or metrics to rank the features and select the most informative ones. The features are assessed independently of the machine learning algorithm to be used."

    "## Q2. How does the Wrapper method differ from the Filter method in feature selection?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The Wrapper method differs from the Filter method in that it evaluates subsets of features by training and testing a specific machine learning algorithm. It uses the predictive performance of the model as the evaluation criterion. The Wrapper method searches through different combinations of features and evaluates their impact on the model's performance, which makes it computationally more expensive compared to the Filter method."

    "Ans: : Some common techniques used in Embedded feature selection methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator): It performs both feature selection and regularization by adding a penalty term to the linear regression objective function.\n",
    "2. Ridge regression: It uses L2 regularization to reduce the impact of less important features.\n",
    "3. Elastic Net: It combines L1 (Lasso) and L2 (Ridge) regularization methods to handle multicollinearity and perform feature selection."

    "1. The Filter method does not consider the interaction between features.\n",

    "\n",
    "Ans: The Filter method is preferred over the Wrapper method for feature selection in the following situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When the dataset is large and computationally expensive to train multiple models, as the Filter method is computationally efficient.\n",
    "2. When there is no need to consider the interaction between features or the specific algorithm used for modeling.\n",
    "3. When the goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset or gain insights into the individual relevance of features."
