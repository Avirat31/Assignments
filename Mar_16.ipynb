    "## Q1: Define overfitting and underfitting in machine learning. What are the consequences of each, and how can they be mitigated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Overfitting occurs when a machine learning model performs well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. It happens when the model learns noise or irrelevant patterns in the training data. Underfitting, on the other hand, occurs when the model fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. The consequences of overfitting include poor performance on new data and high variance, while underfitting leads to high bias and limited predictive power. To mitigate overfitting, techniques like regularization, cross-validation, and increasing the training data can be used. Underfitting can be addressed by using more complex models, adding more features, or reducing regularization."

    "1. Regularization: Introducing a penalty term to the loss function to prevent excessive complexity.\n",
    "2. Cross-validation: Evaluating the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data to get a more reliable estimate of generalization error.\n",
    "3. Feature selection: Selecting the most relevant features to reduce noise and improve generalization.Early stopping: Stopping the training process before overfitting occurs by monitoring the performance on a validation set."

    "## Q3: Explain underfitting. List scenarios where underfitting can occur in ML.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the data. It often happens when the model has insufficient complexity or when there is a lack of relevant features. Underfitting can occur in scenarios where the data is highly non-linear or when the model is too constrained, resulting in poor performance and high bias."

    "## Q4: Explain the bias-variance tradeoff in machine learning. What is the relationship between bias and variance, and how do they affect model performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The bias-variance tradeoff refers to the relationship between the bias and variance of a machine learning model. Bias measures the model's ability to capture the true underlying pattern in the data, while variance measures its sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High bias models have a simplified representation, leading to underfitting, while high variance models have complex representations, leading to overfitting. The goal is to find the right balance between bias and variance to achieve optimal model performance."

    "\n",
    "1. Validation curves: Plotting the model's performance on the training and validation sets against different hyperparameter values to identify overfitting or underfitting.\n",
    "2. Learning curves: Plotting the model's performance on the training and validation sets against the size of the training data to assess if the model is converging or underfitting.\n",
    "3. Evaluation on test data: Assessing the model's performance on a separate test set that was not used during training to evaluate its generalization capability."

    "## Q6: Compare and contrast bias and variance in machine learning. What are some examples of high bias and high variance models, and how do they differ in terms of their performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Bias represents the model's ability to capture the true underlying pattern. High bias models are too simplistic and may underfit the data, resulting in poor performance. Variance represents the model's sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High variance models are overly complex and may overfit the data, performing well on the training set but poorly on new data. An example of a high bias model is a linear regression with few features, while an example of a high variance model is a decision tree with unlimited depth."

    "## Q7: What is regularization in machine learning, and how can it be used to prevent overfitting? Describe some common regularization techniques and how they work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Regularization is a technique used to prevent overfitting in machine learning. It adds a penalty term to the loss function, discouraging the model from fitting the noise in the training data. Common regularization techniques include L1 regularization (Lasso), which encourages sparsity in the model's coefficients, and L2 regularization (Ridge), which encourages small weights. Other techniques like dropout and early stopping can also be used. Regularization helps control the model's complexity and improve generalization performance by finding the right balance between fitting the training data and avoiding overfitting."
