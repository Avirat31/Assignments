    "\n",
    "Ans: Ridge Regression vs. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge Regression is a regularized linear regression technique that adds a penalty term based on the L2 norm of the coefficients to the cost function. It helps prevent overfitting and stabilizes regression estimates, especially in the presence of multicollinearity.\n",
    "- OLS Regression is the standard linear regression without regularization, aiming to minimize the sum of squared residuals between predicted and actual values."

    "Ans: Assumptions of Ridge Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Linearity: The relationship between the predictors and the target variable is assumed to be linear.\n",
    "- Independence: The observations are assumed to be independent of each other.\n",
    "- Homoscedasticity: The variance of the residuals is constant across all values of the predictors.\n",
    "- No perfect multicollinearity: The predictor variables should not be perfectly correlated."

    "Ans: Ridge Regression and multicollinearity:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Ridge Regression performs well in the presence of multicollinearity, as it stabilizes the regression estimates by shrinking the coefficients.\n",
    "- It reduces the sensitivity of the model to multicollinearity, making it more suitable for highly correlated predictor variables."
