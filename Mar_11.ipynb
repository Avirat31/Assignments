    "## Q1: What is the difference between a t-test and a z-test? Provide an example scenario where you would use each type of test.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:A t-test is used when the population standard deviation is unknown and needs to be estimated from the sample. It is appropriate when the sample size is small (typically less than 30) or when the population is assumed to follow a normal distribution. For example, if you want to compare the mean heights of two groups of students, with a sample size of 25 in each group and unknown population standard deviation, you would use a t-test.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, a z-test is used when the population standard deviation is known, or when the sample size is large (typically greater than 30). It assumes a normal distribution of the population. For instance, if you want to compare the mean weights of two large populations (e.g., the mean weights of adult males and females in a country), with sample sizes of 100 or more in each group, and known population standard deviation, you would use a z-test."

This error represents concluding that there is a significant difference or relationship when, in reality, there is not. For example, rejecting the null hypothesis that a person is innocent when they are actually innocent.\n",

    "A doctor is trying to determine whether a patient has a certain disease. The doctor knows that the disease is relatively rare, with a prior probability of 0.01.

    "\n",
    "Ans: The margin of error in a confidence interval is the range around the point estimate (such as the sample mean) within which the true population parameter is estimated to lie with a certain level of confidence. It represents the potential variability or uncertainty in the estimation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample size affects the margin of error inversely. As the sample size increases, the margin of error decreases. This is because larger sample sizes provide more representative and reliable information about the population, leading to a more precise estimate. A larger sample size reduces the variability in the data, resulting in a smaller margin of error.\n",

    "For example, consider a survey to estimate the proportion of people in a city who support a particular policy. If you survey a small random sample of 100 individuals, the margin of error might be, say, ±5%. However, if you increase the sample size to 1,000 individuals, the margin of error may reduce to ±2%. The larger sample provides more precise estimates and decreases the uncertainty associated with the estimation."
