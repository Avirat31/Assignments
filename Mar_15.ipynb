    "Ans: Train Set: The train set is used to train the machine learning model. It contains input features and corresponding target labels (in supervised learning) or unlabeled data (in unsupervised learning). The model learns patterns and relationships from the train set.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Set: The test set is used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. It contains input features and either target labels (in supervised learning) or unlabeled data (in unsupervised learning). The model's predictions on the test set are compared to the actual labels or ground truth to assess its performance.\n",

    "Validation Set: The validation set is an optional subset used during model development and hyperparameter tuning. It helps assess the model's performance on unseen data and make decisions about model selection, regularization, or adjusting hyperparameters. The validation set is used to fine-tune the model without biasing the evaluation on the test set.\n",

    "Test set: It serves as an unbiased evaluation of the trained model's performance. By testing the model on unseen data, it helps estimate how well the model will perform in real-world scenarios and provides an indication of its generalization ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation set: It aids in selecting the best model and optimizing its performance. The validation set helps identify potential issues like overfitting and allows fine-tuning of hyperparameters or model architecture to achieve better performance on unseen data."
