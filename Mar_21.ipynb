    "## Q1. What is the difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding? Provide an example of when you might choose one over the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The main difference between Ordinal Encoding and Label Encoding lies in their application to categorical variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ordinal Encoding assigns a numerical value to each category based on their order or rank. For example, assigning 1, 2, and 3 to the categories \"Low,\" \"Medium,\" and \"High\" respectively, in a variable representing temperature levels.\n",
    "Label Encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category without considering any order. For example, assigning 1, 2, and 3 to the categories \"Red,\" \"Green,\" and \"Blue\" respectively, in a variable representing colors.\n",
    "The choice between the two depends on the nature of the categorical variable. If there is a clear order or hierarchy among the categories, Ordinal Encoding is appropriate. If there is no inherent order, and the categories are merely distinct labels, Label Encoding is suitable.\n"

    "## Q2. Explain how Target Guided Ordinal Encoding works and provide an example of when you might use it in a machine learning project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is a technique where the categories of a categorical variable are encoded based on their relationship with the target variable. Each category is assigned an ordinal value based on the target variable's mean, median, or some other statistical measure. This encoding captures the target variable's influence on the categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of using Target Guided Ordinal Encoding is in a credit risk prediction project. The categorical variable \"Education Level\" can be encoded based on the default rate of each education level. Categories with higher default rates can be assigned higher ordinal values, indicating a higher risk level associated with that category."

    "## Q3. Define covariance and explain why it is important in statistical analysis. How is covariance calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Covariance measures the relationship between two variables in statistical analysis. It quantifies how changes in one variable correspond to changes in another variable. Covariance can be positive, indicating a direct relationship, or negative, indicating an inverse relationship. It is important in statistical analysis because it helps understand the direction and strength of the relationship between variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Covariance is calculated using the formula:\n",
    "cov(X, Y) = Σ[(Xᵢ - X̄)(Yᵢ - Ȳ)] / (n - 1)\n",
    "where X and Y are the variables, X̄ and Ȳ are their means, and n is the number of observations."

The covariance matrix will be a 3x3 matrix, with variances on the diagonal and covariances off the diagonal. The interpretation of the results would depend on the specific values obtained, as positive values indicate a positive relationship, negative values indicate a negative relationship, and larger absolute values indicate stronger relationships."
