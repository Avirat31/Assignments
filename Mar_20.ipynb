    "## Q1. What is data encoding? How is it useful in data science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: Data encoding is the process of converting categorical or textual data into numerical representations that can be used by machine learning algorithms. It is useful in data science because many algorithms require numerical input. By encoding categorical data, we can include it in the analysis and leverage its valuable information."

    "\n",
    "Ans: Nominal encoding, also known as label encoding, assigns a unique integer value to each category in a categorical variable. For example, in a real-world scenario of predicting customer satisfaction, we may have a feature called \"Feedback\" with categories like \"Positive,\" \"Neutral,\" and \"Negative.\" Nominal encoding would assign 1, 2, and 3 to these categories, respectively."

    "## Q3. In what situations is nominal encoding preferred over one-hot encoding? Provide a practical example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  Nominal encoding is preferred over one-hot encoding in situations where there is an inherent order or ranking in the categories. For example, in a dataset of educational degrees (Bachelor's, Master's, Ph.D.), there is a natural order, and using nominal encoding (1, 2, 3) preserves that information. One-hot encoding would create separate binary columns for each category, which would not capture the ordinal relationship."

    "\n",
    "Ans:  If the dataset contains categorical data with 5 unique values, and there is no inherent order or ranking among the categories, one-hot encoding would be a suitable choice. This technique creates binary columns for each category, representing their presence or absence. One-hot encoding is commonly used when dealing with nominal data without ordinal relationships."

    "## Q5. In a machine learning project, you have a dataset with 1000 rows and 5 columns. Two of the columns are categorical, and the remaining three columns are numerical. If you were to use nominal encoding to transform the categorical data, how many new columns would be created? Show your calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: : If you were to use nominal encoding to transform the two categorical columns in a dataset with 1000 rows, you would create two new columns. Since nominal encoding assigns a unique integer value to each category, each categorical column would be replaced with a single numerical column containing integers. Therefore, you would still have 5 columns, with the two original categorical columns replaced by two numerical columns."

    "\n",
    "Ans:  For transforming categorical data about different types of animals (species, habitat, diet), one-hot encoding would be suitable. Each category within each column would be represented by a separate binary column. This encoding preserves the distinct categories and allows machine learning algorithms to consider the presence or absence of each category as a feature."
