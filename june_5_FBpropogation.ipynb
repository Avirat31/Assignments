    "Ans: The purpose of forward propagation in a neural network is to compute the output of the network given a set of input features. During forward propagation, the input data is passed through the network layer by layer, with each layer performing a series of calculations to produce an output. These calculations involve multiplying the input values by the weights of the connections between neurons, applying an activation function to introduce non-linearity, and passing the result to the next layer.\n",

    "The process of forward propagation allows the neural network to make predictions or classifications based on the learned parameters (weights and biases) that were obtained during the training phase. It essentially propagates the input data forward through the network to produce a prediction or output that can be compared to the actual target value during training (for supervised learning tasks) or used for making predictions (for inference)."

    "During forward propagation in a neural network, activation functions are used to introduce non-linearity into the output of each neuron in the network. The purpose of activation functions is to determine whether and to what extent a neuron should be activated based on its input. Here's how activation functions are used during forward propagation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Neuron Output Calculation**:\n",
    "   - In forward propagation, the output of each neuron in the network is calculated by taking a weighted sum of its inputs (from the previous layer) along with a bias term. Mathematically, this can be represented as:\n",
    " z=∑ \n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Applying Activation Function**:\n",
    "   - After computing the weighted sum \\( z \\), the result is passed through an activation function \\( f(z) \\). The activation function introduces non-linearity into the output of the neuron. The purpose of the activation function is to determine whether the neuron should be activated (i.e., its output should be significant) or not based on its input.\n",
    "   - Common activation functions include:\n",
    "     - Sigmoid\n",
    "     - Hyperbolic tangent (tanh)\n",
    "     - Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)\n",
    "     - Leaky ReLU  or similar variants\n",

    "   - The output of the neuron after applying the activation function represents the activated value of the neuron. It determines whether the neuron should be activated or not based on its input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Propagation to Next Layer**:\n",
    "   - The activated output of each neuron serves as input to the neurons in the next layer, and the process repeats for each layer until the final output layer is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activation functions play a crucial role in enabling neural networks to learn complex mappings from input to output by introducing non-linearity into the network. They allow neural networks to approximate complex functions and capture intricate patterns in the data. Choosing an appropriate activation function is essential for the successful training and performance of neural networks."

    "In forward propagation, weights and biases play crucial roles in determining the output of each neuron in the neural network. Here's an overview of their roles:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weights**:\n",
    "   - Weights represent the strength of connections between neurons in adjacent layers of the network. Each neuron in a given layer is connected to every neuron in the subsequent layer, and each connection is associated with a weight.\n",
    "   - During forward propagation, the input to each neuron is multiplied by its corresponding weight. This multiplication reflects the importance or significance of the input feature to the neuron's output. Mathematically, the weighted sum of inputs is calculated as:\n",

    "   where \\( z \\) is the weighted sum, \\( w_i \\) are the weights, and \\( x_i \\) are the input values.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Biases**:\n",
    "   - Biases are additional parameters in each neuron that allow the network to learn a constant offset or baseline value. They provide neurons with the ability to output values even when all inputs are zero.\n",
    "   - During forward propagation, the bias term is added to the weighted sum of inputs before passing through the activation function. This allows the activation function to shift its output along the axis.\n",
    "   - Mathematically, the weighted sum with bias is calculated as:\n",

    "3. **Combination**:\n",
    "   - The combination of weights and biases determines the behavior and output of each neuron in the network. By adjusting the weights and biases during the training process, the network learns to make accurate predictions or classifications based on the input data.\n",
    "   - Through the process of training (e.g., using backpropagation and optimization algorithms like gradient descent), the network adjusts the weights and biases to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, weights and biases control how information flows through the neural network during forward propagation. They allow the network to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data and make accurate predictions or classifications. Adjusting the weights and biases during training is essential for the network to learn from data and improve its performance over time."
