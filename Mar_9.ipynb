    "## Q1: What are the Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF)? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF) are mathematical functions used in probability theory and statistics to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF is used for discrete random variables and gives the probability that the random variable takes on a specific value. It assigns probabilities to each possible outcome. For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the outcome can be described as: P(X = 1) = 1/6, P(X = 2) = 1/6, P(X = 3) = 1/6, P(X = 4) = 1/6, P(X = 5) = 1/6, P(X = 6) = 1/6, where X represents the random variable representing the outcome of the die roll.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables and represents the probability distribution as a continuous function. It gives the relative likelihood of the random variable falling within a certain range of values. The area under the PDF curve between two points represents the probability of the random variable falling within that range. For example, the PDF of a standard normal distribution can be represented by the bell-shaped curve."

    "## Q2: What is Cumulative Density Function (CDF)? Explain with an example. Why CDF is used? \n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) is a function that gives the probability that a random variable is less than or equal to a specified value. It provides information about the entire distribution of the random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is defined as the integral of the PDF for continuous random variables or the sum of the PMF for discrete random variables. The CDF increases monotonically from 0 to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the standard normal distribution. The CDF of the standard normal distribution gives the probability that a randomly selected observation from this distribution is less than or equal to a specified value. It can be denoted as P(Z ≤ z), where Z represents the standard normal random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CDF is used to calculate probabilities and percentiles for specific values or ranges of values of a random variable. It allows us to determine the probability of observing a value less than or equal to a given value or the value at which a certain percentile is reached. The CDF is essential for various statistical analyses and hypothesis testing."

    "## Q3: What are some examples of situations where the normal distribution might be used as a model Explain how the parameters of the normal distribution relate to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: The normal distribution is commonly used as a model in various situations where the data can be reasonably assumed to follow a symmetric and bell-shaped distribution. Some examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Height: The distribution of heights in a population tends to follow a normal distribution, with most people clustered around the average height.\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Scores: When a large number of people take a standardized test, their scores often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurement Errors: Errors in measurements or observations, such as the errors in scientific experiments, are often assumed to follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is defined by two parameters: the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the central tendency or average value of the distribution, and it determines the location of the peak of the distribution. The standard deviation controls the spread or dispersion of the distribution. A larger standard deviation leads to a wider distribution, while a smaller standard deviation leads to a narrower distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape of the normal distribution is symmetric around the mean. Approximately 68% of the data falls within one standard deviation of the mean, about 95% falls within two standard deviations, and approximately 99.7% falls within three standard deviations. This characteristic of the normal distribution is known as the 68-95-99.7 rule."

    "Widely Applicable: The normal distribution is a versatile and widely applicable model that approximates the distribution of many real-world phenomena.\n",

    "## Q5: What is Bernaulli Distribution? Give an Example. What is the difference between Bernoulli Distribution and Binomial Distribution?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The Bernoulli distribution is a discrete probability distribution that models a random experiment with two possible outcomes: success (usually denoted as 1) and failure (usually denoted as 0). It is characterized by a single parameter, p, which represents the probability of success.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the Bernoulli distribution is modeling the outcome of a single coin flip, where success represents getting heads and failure represents getting tails. The probability of getting heads, denoted as p, can be any value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Bernoulli distribution and the Binomial distribution is that the Bernoulli distribution models a single trial or experiment with two outcomes, while the Binomial distribution models the number of successes in a fixed number of independent Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Binomial distribution, there are multiple independent Bernoulli trials, each with the same probability of success (p). The Binomial distribution is characterized by two parameters: the number of trials (n) and the probability of success (p). It represents the probability distribution of the number of successes (k) in the n trials."

    "\n",
    "Ans: To calculate the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normal distribution will be greater than a specific value, we can use the standard normal distribution (z-distribution) and the z-score.\n",
    "\n",
    "The z-score is calculated as (x - μ) / σ, where x is the value we want to find the probability for, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation.\n",

    "First, we calculate the z-score:\n",
    "z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we use a standard normal distribution table or a statistical calculator to find the cumulative probability associated with the z-score of 1. The cumulative probability represents the probability of a value being less than or equal to the given z-score. In this case, we want the probability of a value being greater than 60, so we subtract the cumulative probability from 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X > 60) = 1 - P(X ≤ 60)\n",

    "Using a standard normal distribution table or a calculator, the cumulative probability for a z-score of 1 is approximately 0.8413. Therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X > 60) = 1 - 0.8413 = 0.1587\n",

    "## Q7: Explain uniform Distribution with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  The uniform distribution is a continuous probability distribution where all values within a specified interval have an equal probability of occurring. In other words, it represents a situation where every possible outcome is equally likely.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider rolling a fair six-sided die. The outcomes (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) have an equal probability of 1/6. This can be described as a uniform distribution because each outcome has the same probability of occurring.\n",

    "Ans: The z-score, also known as the standard score, is a measure of how many standard deviations an observation or data point is away from the mean of a distribution. It is calculated by subtracting the mean from the data point and dividing the result by the standard deviation.\n",
