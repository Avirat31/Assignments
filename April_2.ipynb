    "## Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:\n",
    "- Purpose: Grid Search CV is used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. It helps find the best combination of hyperparameters by evaluating the model's performance on a grid of possible parameter values.\n",
    "- Working: Grid Search CV exhaustively searches all possible combinations of hyperparameters provided in the grid and performs cross-validation to find the combination with the best performance."

    "## Q2. Describe the difference between grid search cv and randomize search cv, and when might you choose one over the other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "- Difference: Grid Search CV performs an exhaustive search over a predefined set of hyperparameter values, while Randomized Search CV randomly samples hyperparameter values from predefined distributions.\n",
    "- Choice: Use Grid Search CV when you have a limited set of hyperparameter values to explore. Use Randomized Search CV when you have a large hyperparameter space and want to explore a wide range of values more efficiently."

    "## Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: \n",
    "- Data Leakage: Data leakage occurs when information from the target variable is inadvertently included in the training data, leading to artificially inflated model performance.\n",
    "- Problem: Data leakage can result in an overly optimistic evaluation of the model's performance, making it less reliable for real-world predictions."

    "- Examining the confusion matrix helps identify if the model is biased towards a specific class by analyzing TP, TN, FP, and FN counts.\n",
