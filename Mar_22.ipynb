    "## Q1. Pearson correlation coefficient is a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans:  To calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient between the amount of time students spend studying for an exam and their final exam scores, use a statistical package or library like NumPy or pandas. The coefficient will range from -1 to 1. A positive value close to 1 indicates a strong positive linear relationship, implying that more study time is associated with higher exam scores. A negative value close to -1 indicates a strong negative linear relationship, suggesting that more study time is associated with lower exam scores. A value close to 0 suggests a weak or no linear relationship."

    "## Q2. Spearman's rank correlation is a measure of the monotonic relationship between two variables. Suppose you have collected data on the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level on a scale of 1 to 10. Calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and interpret the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To calculate the Spearman's rank correlation between the amount of sleep individuals get each night and their overall job satisfaction level, use a statistical package or library. The coefficient will range from -1 to 1. A positive value close to 1 indicates a strong monotonic relationship, suggesting that as sleep duration increases, job satisfaction also tends to increase. A negative value close to -1 indicates a strong inverse monotonic relationship, implying that as sleep duration increases, job satisfaction tends to decrease. A value close to 0 suggests a weak or no monotonic relationship."

    "## Q3. Suppose you are conducting a study to examine the relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) in a sample of adults. You collected data on both variables for 50 participants. Calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation between these two variables and compare the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: To compare the relationship between the number of hours of exercise per week and body mass index (BMI) using both Pearson correlation coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation, calculate these coefficients using a statistical package or library. The Pearson correlation coefficient measures the linear relationship between the variables, while the Spearman's rank correlation measures the monotonic relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the Pearson correlation coefficient and the Spearman's rank correlation are both close to 1, it indicates a strong positive monotonic relationship. If the Pearson correlation coefficient is close to 1 but the Spearman's rank correlation is not, it suggests a linear relationship but not necessarily monotonic. If the Spearman's rank correlation is close to 1 but the Pearson correlation coefficient is not, it suggests a monotonic relationship but not necessarily linear. Comparing the two coefficients can provide insights into the nature of the relationship between the variables."
