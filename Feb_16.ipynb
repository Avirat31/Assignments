    "### Q1. What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A database is an organized collection of data that can be accessed, managed, and updated easily. It is typically designed to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data in a structured manner. Databases are used in a wide range of applications, including websites, mobile apps, enterprise software, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two broad categories of databases: SQL and NoSQL. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in tables with rows and columns, which are connected by keys that establish relationships between the data. SQL databases use a standardized language called SQL (Structured Query Language) to interact with the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that store data in a variety of different formats, such as key-value pairs, documents, or graphs. NoSQL databases are designed to be highly scalable and flexible, making them well-suited for applications that require large volumes of unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some key differences between SQL and NoSQL databases include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data structure: SQL databases use a tabular structure with rows and columns, while NoSQL databases use various data models such as document, key-value, graph, and others.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Scalability: NoSQL databases are highly scalable and can easily handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads, while scaling SQL databases can be more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Flexibility: NoSQL databases are highly flexible and can adapt to changing data structures and types, while SQL databases have more rigid structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Query language: SQL databases use SQL as a standardized language for querying and managing data, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages and APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. ACID compliance: SQL databases are typically ACID-compliant, meaning they provide transactional consistency and data integrity, while NoSQL databases may prioritize availability and partition tolerance over strict consistency."

    "### Q2. What is DDL? Explain why CREATE, DROP, ALTER, and TRUNCATE are used with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: DDL stands for Data Definition Language, which is a subset of SQL (Structured Query Language) that is used to define and modify the structure of a database. DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and other schema-level objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. CREATE: The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects, such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. For example, to create a new table named \"employees\" with columns for employee ID, name, and salary, \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "   employee_id INT,\n",

    "   \n",
    "   salary DECIMAL(10,2)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DROP: The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects. For example, to delete the \"employees\" table,\n",
    "\n",
    "DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ALTER: The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of an existing database object, such as adding, modifying, or deleting columns in a table. For example, to add a new column for employee age to the \"employees\" table\n",
    "\n",
    "ALTER TABLE employees ADD age INT;\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. TRUNCATE: The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all data from a table, while keeping the table structure intact. For example, to remove all data from the \"employees\" table, \n",
    "\n",
    "TRUNCATE TABLE employees;\n"

    "### Q5. Explain Primary Key and Foreign Key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans: A primary key and a foreign key are both types of constraints that can be used to ensure data integrity in a relational database.\n",
    "\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is used to enforce the entity integrity constraint, which ensures that each row in the table is unique and can be identified by a unique value. A primary key can be composed of one or more columns in a table and can be either a single column or a combination of columns. The values in the primary key column(s) must be unique, and cannot be null. A primary key can be used as a reference in another table using a foreign key constraint.\n",
    "\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It is used to enforce the referential integrity constraint, which ensures that the data in a table is consistent and accurate. The foreign key constraint creates a relationship between two tables, and ensures that the values in the foreign key column(s) in one table correspond to the values in the primary key column(s) in another table. This constraint can prevent the insertion of invalid data, by preventing the insertion of data into the foreign key column(s) that does not exist in the primary key column(s) of the referenced table"
