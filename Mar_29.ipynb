    "\n",
    "Ans: Lasso Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lasso Regression is a linear regression technique that adds an L1 regularization penalty to the cost function.\n",
    "- It differs from other regression techniques by using the absolute values of the coefficients in the regularization term.\n",
    "- Lasso can perform feature selection by forcing some coefficients to be exactly zero, effectively eliminating less important predictors from the model."

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- The main tuning parameter is \"lambda\" (also denoted as \"alpha\"), which controls the strength of the regularization.\n",
    "- Larger lambda values increase the penalty, leading to more regularization and a sparser model.\n",
    "- Smaller lambda values reduce the penalty, allowing more predictors to have non-zero coefficients."

    "- Both Ridge and Lasso add regularization terms to the cost function, but Ridge uses L2 regularization (squares of coefficients), while Lasso uses L1 regularization (absolute values of coefficients).\n",
